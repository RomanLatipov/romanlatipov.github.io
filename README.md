This app is supposed to display the weather for any city on Earth. The api endpoint is
OpenWeatherMap which provides free weather data and a weather api in JSON, XML, and HTML formats.
To use the app simply enter the name of a city in the search bar and press the button.
It's best to specify the country as well since lots of cities share the same name. There is a 
'London' in the UK and in Canada thus you should type 'London,UK' or 'London,CA' to specify
which London you want other wise just typing "London' in the search bar will provide
information for London in the UK by default.
